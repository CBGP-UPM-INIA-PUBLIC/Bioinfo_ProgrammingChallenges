    "On May 1, 2018, NCBI will begin enforcing the use of API keys that will offer enhanced levels of supported access to the E-utilities. After that date, any site (IP address) posting more than 3 requests per second to the E-utilities without an API key will receive an error message. By including an API key, a site can post up to 10 requests per second by default. Higher rates are available by request (vog.hin.mln.ibcn@seitilitue). Users can obtain an API key now from the Settings page of their NCBI account (to create an account, visit www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/account/). After creating the key, users should include it in each E-utility request by assigning it to the new api_key parameter.\n",

    "Example error message if rates are exceeded:\n",
    "{\"error\":\"API rate limit exceeded\",\"count\":\"11\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "Only one API key is allowed per NCBI account; however, a user may request a new key at any time. Such a request will invalidate any existing API key associated with that NCBI account.\n",
    "\n",
    "We encourage regular E-utility users to obtain an API key as soon as possible and begin the process of incorporating it into code. We also encourage users to monitor their request rates to determine if they will require rates higher than 10 per second. As stated above, we can potentially have higher rates negotiated prior to the beginning of enforcement on May 1, 2018.</em>\n",
