    "\n",
    "REST is a design philosophy for client/server-style software.  It says:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Every \"Thing\" should be designated by ONE globally unique identifier/address\n",
    "2. Every \"Thing\" exists in a particular \"state\"\n",
    "    * e.g. if a=2, then the state of \"a\" is \"2\"\n",
    "3. There are a limited number of uniform (i.e. globally accepted) functions a client may use to request/query/modify the state of the Thing\n",
    "    * this means that you are not allowed to invent your own API!!!\n",
    "4. The software is \"stateless\" - after performing an operation on a Thing, the client forgets everything it knows, and the Thing also forgets that it was visited by the client.  The system \"has no memory\"\n",
    "    * this means, NO COOKIES!\n",
    "5. Because the system is stateless (has no memory), the current state of the \"Thing\", and all operations on a \"Thing\" that are valid at a given moment, must be reported by the \"Thing's\" server, to the client, using \"Hypertext\" (a way to describe the current \"state\", and possible actions, in a machine-readable way)\n",
    "6. the client then selects one of those valid operations and executes it, using one of the limited number of uniform fuctions (see [3] above).\n",
    "7. finally, the client is able to retrieve the \"Thing\" in one or more \"representations\" (e.g. retrieve the AB13345 record in GenBank or XML or EMBL or PDF format) using the same identifier in every case, and one of the functions in [3] above.\n",

    "# REST on the Web\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common way to implement REST on the Web is to use the Hypertext Transfer Protocol ([HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol)) and Uniform Resource Identifiers ([URIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier)).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# HTTP\n",
    "\n",
    "At the core of HTTP are 5 \"methods\" (there are 2 additional methods, but they are not very consistently implemented):\n",
    "\n",
    "* GET - retrieve\n",
    "* PUT - create/replace\n",
    "* POST - process/update\n",
    "* HEAD  - request metadata\n",
    "* DELETE - remove\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# REST using HTTP\n",
    "\n",
    "* GET URL - retrieve the current state of URL\n",
    "* PUT URL [data] - create/replace the current state of URL with [data]\n",
    "* POST URL [data] - process [data] in manner defined by URL hypertext; update state of URL with that result\n",
    "* HEAD URL  - request metadata about current state of URL\n",
    "* DELETE URL - set state of URL to be NULL\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Requesting a specific Representation in REST+HTTP\n",
    "\n",
    "In REST, everything is represented by a single, globally-unique URI (URL).  How, then, can we get the XML version, or the HTML version, or the PDF version?  On the Web, this is achieved through [Content-negotiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_negotiation).  The client can, for example through a HEAD request, ask the server what representations are available for a Resource.  The client responds with a set of [Media types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type)\n",
    "it can provide, using their [MIME-type abbreviation](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml).\n",
    "\n",
    "    e.g.  application/pdf, image/png\n",
    "    \n",
    "In this way, the client can say \"please give me the current state of URL_XXX in the format 'image/png'\"\n",

    "\n",
    "First, there are hardly any interfaces in Bioinformatics that follow the rules above.  Even the ones that claim to be REST, almost never are!  **This is not a bad thing**!  REST is actually pretty hard, and most interfaces that claim to be REST are actually quite useful!!  The bad thing is that bioinformatics websites CLAIM to be REST only __because it is cool__, but without understanding how hard it really is.  Since they don't understand, they try to make REST simple, and they break the rules to achieve this... so they are not REST anymore :-)\n",
