    "On May 1, 2018, NCBI will begin enforcing the use of API keys that will offer enhanced levels of supported access to the E-utilities. After that date, any site (IP address) posting more than 3 requests per second to the E-utilities without an API key will receive an error message. By including an API key, a site can post up to 10 requests per second by default. Higher rates are available by request (vog.hin.mln.ibcn@seitilitue). Users can obtain an API key now from the Settings page of their NCBI account (to create an account, visit www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/account/). After creating the key, users should include it in each E-utility request by assigning it to the new api_key parameter.\n",

    "Example error message if rates are exceeded:\n",
    "{\"error\":\"API rate limit exceeded\",\"count\":\"11\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "Only one API key is allowed per NCBI account; however, a user may request a new key at any time. Such a request will invalidate any existing API key associated with that NCBI account.\n",
    "\n",
    "We encourage regular E-utility users to obtain an API key as soon as possible and begin the process of incorporating it into code. We also encourage users to monitor their request rates to determine if they will require rates higher than 10 per second. As stated above, we can potentially have higher rates negotiated prior to the beginning of enforcement on May 1, 2018.</em>\n",

    "Our task is to get the abstracts for the nucleotide sequence files that were discovered in the search above.  This is called a \"Link\".  Earlier in this Lesson, we looked at the output from the EInfo tool - it told you what FIELDs you could query for each database, but also what LINKS existed between one database and another.  Let's look at that again - the EInfo about the nuccore database:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/einfo.fcgi?db=nuccore\n",

    "        <Menu>PubMed Links</Menu>\n",
    "        <Description>PubMed articles cited by Nucleotide sequence record</Description>\n",
    "        <DbTo>pubmed</DbTo>\n",
    "    </Link>\n",
    "\n",
    "This describes that there is a link between nuccore (the sequence database) and pubmed (the publications database).  The tool that we need to find the links between the list of IDs for Database A and the list of IDs for Database B is the ELink tool\n",
    "\n",
    "http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi\n",
    "\n",
    "It works like all other EUtils; however, there is no BioRuby wrapper for this one, so we must do the hard work ourselves.  To see some example code in Perl go to:  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25498/#chapter3.Application_4_Finding_unique_se.  We will now do the same thing in Ruby.\n",

    "* db  (i.e. which db are you linking TO)\n",
    "* id = ...list of ids...\n",

    "\n",
    "If you click on that, you will see the XML document that contains the PubMed IDs that correspond to the nucleotide sequence IDs we sent to the **elink** tool.  They are separated into \"Link Sets\", corresponding to different subsections of pubmed (e.g. **nuccore_pubmed_refseq**).  \n",
    "\n",

There is no set maximum for the number of UIDs that can be passed to ELink, but **if more than about 200 UIDs are to be provided, the request should be made using the HTTP POST method.**\n",

    "What does \"HTTP POST\" mean?   We will discuss it in detail in a later lecture, but for now, you only need to understand that it is another way of sending information to a Web server.  Using HTTP GET, you put the information at the end of the URL (<code>scriptname?a=b;c=d;...</code>).   With HTTP POST you send it in the \"body\" of a message.  \n",

    "It is important to learn how to create an HTTP POST request, so even though we _can_ use the URL above (because we only have 5 ID numbers), we should look at and understand the other solution.  An example of an HTTP POST is below, where we are sending a request to the ELink service of NCBI:\n",

To discover \\n      a novel locus, we performed in vitro genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and\\n      further tested the result in a cohort of septic shock patients. METHODS: Two in\\n      vitro GWAS using a quantitative trait locus analysis of stimulated IL-6\\n      production in lymphoblastoid cells from 60 individuals of European ancestry were \\n      performed. VPS13D rs6685273 was genotyped in European ancestry patients (n =\\n      498). The VPS13D gene was silenced in vitro. RESULTS: Two GWAS using\\n      lymphoblastoid cells identified the locus of VPS13D rs6685273 that was\\n      significant in the same direction in both GWAS. The VPS13D rs6685273 C allele was\\n      associated with increased IL-6 production. Patients with septic shock who had the\\n      VPS13D rs6685273 CC genotype had an increased 28-day mortality (p = 0.023) and\\n      more organ failure (p < 0.05) compared to the CT/TT genotypes. VPS13D in vitro\\n      gene silencing in the HeLa cell line increased IL-6 production. Furthermore, the \\n      rs6685273 genotype was associated with differential VPS13D splice variant\\n      expression. CONCLUSIONS: The VPS13D rs6685273 C allele was associated with\\n      increased IL-6 production in vitro. The patients with the VPS13D rs6685273 CC\\n      genotype had increased 28-day mortality and increased organ failure. VPS13D\\n      appears to regulate IL-6 production.\\nCI  - (c) 2015 S.

However,\\n      little is known about the genetic basis of PAD. To elucidate this, we performed a\\n      two-staged genome-wide association study in Japanese individuals. METHODS: We\\n      initially tested 222,285 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). After the first \\n      screening in a panel of 195 PAD cases and 1,358 controls, 2,696 SNPs (1.2%) were \\n      further genotyped in the second screening using another panel of 699 PAD cases\\n      and 1540 controls. In both screenings, controls were subjects affected with some \\n      diseases other than PAD. RESULTS: When analyzed in the combined panel, the\\n      strongest signal of PAD association was observed at rs1902341 in the intron of\\n      OSBPL10 (p=4.7E-7 for trend test; OR=1.31, 95% CI 1.18-1.46). Also, PAD was\\n      modestly associated at several other loci such as rs2554503 in CSMD1 (p=5.7E-5;\\n      OR=1.32, 95% CI 1.15-1.51) or rs235243 in VSP13D (p=0.04; OR=1.18, 95% CI\\n      1.01-1.37). CONCLUSION: Our genome-wide exploration identified suggestive\\n      evidence of PAD association at the OSBPL10 locus. Because the association has not\\n      reached a genome-wide significant level, further replication study is warranted\\n      for verification in the Japanese population.\\nFAU - Koriyama, Hiroshi\\nAU  - Koriyama H\\nAD  - Department of Geriatric Medicine and Nephrology, Osaka University Graduate School\\n      of Medicine, 2-2 Yamada-oka, Suita, Japan.\\nFAU - Nakagami, Hironori\\nAU  - Nakagami H\\nFAU - Katsuya, Tomohiro\\nAU  - Katsuya T\\nFAU - Sugimoto, Ken\\nAU  - Sugimoto K\\nFAU - Yamashita, Hidetoshi\\nAU  - Yamashita H\\nFAU - Takami, Yoichi\\nAU  - Takami Y\\nFAU - Maeda, Shiro\\nAU  - Maeda S\\nFAU - Kubo, Michiaki\\nAU  - Kubo M\\nFAU - Takahashi, Atsushi\\nAU  - Takahashi A\\nFAU - Nakamura, Yusuke\\nAU  - Nakamura Y\\nFAU - Ogihara, Toshio\\nAU  - Ogihara T\\nFAU - Rakugi, Hiromi\\nAU  - Rakugi H\\nFAU - Kaneda, Yasufumi\\nAU  - Kaneda Y\\nFAU - Morishita, Ryuichi\\nAU  - Morishita R\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Comparative Study\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't\\nDEP - 20100702\\nPL  - Japan\\nTA  - J Atheroscler Thromb\\nJT  - Journal of atherosclerosis and thrombosis\\nJID - 9506298\\nRN  - 0 (Receptors, Steroid)\\nRN  - 0 (oxysterol binding protein)\\nSB  - IM\\nMH  - Aged\\nMH  - Asian Continental Ancestry Group/*genetics\\nMH  - Case-Control Studies\\nMH  - Female\\nMH  - Genetic Predisposition to Disease\\nMH  - Genome, Human\\nMH  - *Genome-Wide Association Study\\nMH  - Genotype\\nMH  - Humans\\nMH  - Japan/epidemiology\\nMH  - Linkage Disequilibrium\\nMH  - Male\\nMH  - Middle Aged\\nMH  - Peripheral Vascular Diseases/epidemiology/*genetics\\nMH  - Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics\\nMH  - Receptors, Steroid/*genetics\\nEDAT- 2010/07/09 06:00\\nMHDA- 2011/03/09 06:00\\nCRDT- 2010/07/09 06:00\\nPHST- 2010/07/09 06:00 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2010/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2011/03/09 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - JST.JSTAGE/jat/4291 [pii]\\nPST - ppublish\\nSO  - J Atheroscler Thromb. 2010 Oct 27;17(10):1054-62.

Here, we used LC-MS/MS\\n      to profile the proteome of human urinary exosomes. Overall, the analysis\\n      identified 1132 proteins unambiguously, including 177 that are represented on the\\n      Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man database of disease-related genes, suggesting\\n      that exosome analysis is a potential approach to discover urinary biomarkers.

It is conceivable, therefore, that such proteins could\\n      function as an intricate framework of assembly protein complexes. To\\n      comprehensively study protein-protein interactions between large KIAA proteins,\\n      we have constructed a library composed of 1087 KIAA cDNA clones based on prior\\n      functional classifications done in silico. We were guided by two principles that \\n      raise the success rate for detecting interactions per tested combination: we\\n      avoided testing low-probability combinations, and reduced the number of potential\\n      false negatives that arise from the fact that large proteins cannot reliably be\\n      expressed in yeast. The latter was addressed by constructing a cDNA library\\n      comprised of random fragments encoding large proteins. Cytoplasmic domains of\\n      KIAA transmembrane proteins (>1000 amino acids) were used as bait for yeast\\n      two-hybrid screening. Our analyses reveal that several KIAA proteins bearing a\\n      transmembrane region have the capability of binding to other KIAA proteins\\n      containing domains (e.g., PDZ, SH3, rhoGEF, and spectrin) known to be localized\\n      to highly specialized submembranous sites, indicating that they participate in\\n      cellular junction formation, receptor or channel clustering, and intracellular\\n      signaling events.

To discover \\n      a novel locus, we performed in vitro genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and\\n      further tested the result in a cohort of septic shock patients. METHODS: Two in\\n      vitro GWAS using a quantitative trait locus analysis of stimulated IL-6\\n      production in lymphoblastoid cells from 60 individuals of European ancestry were \\n      performed. VPS13D rs6685273 was genotyped in European ancestry patients (n =\\n      498). The VPS13D gene was silenced in vitro. RESULTS: Two GWAS using\\n      lymphoblastoid cells identified the locus of VPS13D rs6685273 that was\\n      significant in the same direction in both GWAS. The VPS13D rs6685273 C allele was\\n      associated with increased IL-6 production. Patients with septic shock who had the\\n      VPS13D rs6685273 CC genotype had an increased 28-day mortality (p = 0.023) and\\n      more organ failure (p < 0.05) compared to the CT/TT genotypes. VPS13D in vitro\\n      gene silencing in the HeLa cell line increased IL-6 production. Furthermore, the \\n      rs6685273 genotype was associated with differential VPS13D splice variant\\n      expression. CONCLUSIONS: The VPS13D rs6685273 C allele was associated with\\n      increased IL-6 production in vitro. The patients with the VPS13D rs6685273 CC\\n      genotype had increased 28-day mortality and increased organ failure. VPS13D\\n      appears to regulate IL-6 production.\\nCI  - (c) 2015 S.

However,\\n      little is known about the genetic basis of PAD. To elucidate this, we performed a\\n      two-staged genome-wide association study in Japanese individuals. METHODS: We\\n      initially tested 222,285 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). After the first \\n      screening in a panel of 195 PAD cases and 1,358 controls, 2,696 SNPs (1.2%) were \\n      further genotyped in the second screening using another panel of 699 PAD cases\\n      and 1540 controls. In both screenings, controls were subjects affected with some \\n      diseases other than PAD. RESULTS: When analyzed in the combined panel, the\\n      strongest signal of PAD association was observed at rs1902341 in the intron of\\n      OSBPL10 (p=4.7E-7 for trend test; OR=1.31, 95% CI 1.18-1.46). Also, PAD was\\n      modestly associated at several other loci such as rs2554503 in CSMD1 (p=5.7E-5;\\n      OR=1.32, 95% CI 1.15-1.51) or rs235243 in VSP13D (p=0.04; OR=1.18, 95% CI\\n      1.01-1.37). CONCLUSION: Our genome-wide exploration identified suggestive\\n      evidence of PAD association at the OSBPL10 locus. Because the association has not\\n      reached a genome-wide significant level, further replication study is warranted\\n      for verification in the Japanese population.\\nFAU - Koriyama, Hiroshi\\nAU  - Koriyama H\\nAD  - Department of Geriatric Medicine and Nephrology, Osaka University Graduate School\\n      of Medicine, 2-2 Yamada-oka, Suita, Japan.\\nFAU - Nakagami, Hironori\\nAU  - Nakagami H\\nFAU - Katsuya, Tomohiro\\nAU  - Katsuya T\\nFAU - Sugimoto, Ken\\nAU  - Sugimoto K\\nFAU - Yamashita, Hidetoshi\\nAU  - Yamashita H\\nFAU - Takami, Yoichi\\nAU  - Takami Y\\nFAU - Maeda, Shiro\\nAU  - Maeda S\\nFAU - Kubo, Michiaki\\nAU  - Kubo M\\nFAU - Takahashi, Atsushi\\nAU  - Takahashi A\\nFAU - Nakamura, Yusuke\\nAU  - Nakamura Y\\nFAU - Ogihara, Toshio\\nAU  - Ogihara T\\nFAU - Rakugi, Hiromi\\nAU  - Rakugi H\\nFAU - Kaneda, Yasufumi\\nAU  - Kaneda Y\\nFAU - Morishita, Ryuichi\\nAU  - Morishita R\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Comparative Study\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't\\nDEP - 20100702\\nPL  - Japan\\nTA  - J Atheroscler Thromb\\nJT  - Journal of atherosclerosis and thrombosis\\nJID - 9506298\\nRN  - 0 (Receptors, Steroid)\\nRN  - 0 (oxysterol binding protein)\\nSB  - IM\\nMH  - Aged\\nMH  - Asian Continental Ancestry Group/*genetics\\nMH  - Case-Control Studies\\nMH  - Female\\nMH  - Genetic Predisposition to Disease\\nMH  - Genome, Human\\nMH  - *Genome-Wide Association Study\\nMH  - Genotype\\nMH  - Humans\\nMH  - Japan/epidemiology\\nMH  - Linkage Disequilibrium\\nMH  - Male\\nMH  - Middle Aged\\nMH  - Peripheral Vascular Diseases/epidemiology/*genetics\\nMH  - Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics\\nMH  - Receptors, Steroid/*genetics\\nEDAT- 2010/07/09 06:00\\nMHDA- 2011/03/09 06:00\\nCRDT- 2010/07/09 06:00\\nPHST- 2010/07/09 06:00 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2010/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2011/03/09 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - JST.JSTAGE/jat/4291 [pii]\\nPST - ppublish\\nSO  - J Atheroscler Thromb. 2010 Oct 27;17(10):1054-62.

Treatment\\n      studies document the efficacy of precessation NRT and support important roles for\\n      level of nicotine dependence and precessation smoking reduction in successful\\n      quitting. However, prior work has not identified the optimal precessation dose or\\n      means for personalizing NRT. Genome-wide association has identified groups of\\n      genomic markers associated with successful quitting, allowing us to develop a\\n      v1.0 \\\"quit-success\\\" genotype score. We now report influences of v1.0 quit-success\\n      genotype score, level of dependence and precessation smoking reduction in a\\n      smoking cessation trial that examined effects of 21 versus 42 mg/24 h\\n      precessation NRT. Four hundred seventy-nine smokers were randomized to 21 or 42\\n      mg NRT, initiated 2 wks prior to target quit dates. We monitored self-reported\\n      abstinence and end-expired air carbon monoxide (CO). Genotyping used Affymetrix\\n      arrays (Santa Clara, CA, USA). The primary outcome was 10-wk continuous smoking\\n      abstinence. NRT dose, level of nicotine dependence and genotype scores displayed \\n      significant interactive effects on successful quitting. Successful abstinence\\n      also was predicted by CO reductions during precessation NRT. These results\\n      document ways in which smoking cessation strategies can be personalized based on \\n      levels of nicotine dependence, genotype scores and CO monitoring. These\\n      assessments, taken together, can help match most smokers with optimal NRT doses\\n      and help rapidly identify some who may be better treated using other methods.\\nFAU - Rose, Jed E\\nAU  - Rose JE\\nAD  - Department of Psychiatry and Center for Nicotine and Smoking Cessation Research, \\n      Duke University, Durham, North Carolina 27705, USA. rose0003@mc.duke.edu\\nFAU - Behm, Frederique M\\nAU  - Behm FM\\nFAU - Drgon, Tomas\\nAU  - Drgon T\\nFAU - Johnson, Catherine\\nAU  - Johnson C\\nFAU - Uhl, George R\\nAU  - Uhl GR\\nLA  - eng\\nSI  - ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT00734617\\nGR  - P50 DA027840/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States\\nGR  - Intramural NIH HHS/United States\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nPT  - Randomized Controlled Trial\\nPT  - Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural\\nPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't\\nDEP - 20100317\\nPL  - United States\\nTA  - Mol Med\\nJT  - Molecular medicine (Cambridge, Mass.)\\nJID - 9501023\\nRN  - 0 (Delayed-Action Preparations)\\nRN  - 6M3C89ZY6R (Nicotine)\\nRN  - 7U1EE4V452 (Carbon Monoxide)\\nSB  - IM\\nEIN - Mol Med. 2012;18(1):729\\nMH  - Administration, Cutaneous\\nMH  - Adult\\nMH  - Carbon Monoxide/analysis\\nMH  - Delayed-Action Preparations\\nMH  - Double-Blind Method\\nMH  - Female\\nMH  - Genome-Wide Association Study\\nMH  - Genotype\\nMH  - Humans\\nMH  - Logistic Models\\nMH  - Male\\nMH  - Middle Aged\\nMH  - Nicotine/*administration & dosage\\nMH  - Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide\\nMH  - Precision Medicine/*methods\\nMH  - Smoking Cessation/*methods\\nMH  - Tobacco Use Disorder/*drug therapy/*genetics\\nPMC - PMC2896464\\nOID - NLM: PMC2896464\\nEDAT- 2010/04/10 06:00\\nMHDA- 2010/11/09 06:00\\nCRDT- 2010/04/10 06:00\\nPHST- 2009/10/31 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2010/03/16 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2010/04/10 06:00 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2010/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2010/11/09 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - molmed.2009.00159 [pii]\\nAID - 10.2119/molmed.2009.00159 [doi]\\nPST - ppublish\\nSO  - Mol Med. 2010 Jul-Aug;16(7-8):247-53. doi: 10.2119/molmed.2009.00159.

We detected several similar\\n      putative human proteins by BLAST analysis of chorein. We characterized the\\n      structure of three new genes encoding these CHAC-similar proteins, located on\\n      chromosomes 1p36, 8q22, and 15q21. The most similar gene in yeast to all four\\n      human genes is Vps13, and therefore the human genes were named VPS13A (CHAC,\\n      9q21), VPS13B (8q22), VPS13C (15q21), and VPS13D (1p36). VPS13B has recently been\\n      reported as COH1, altered in Cohen syndrome. For each gene, we describe several\\n      alternative splicing variants; at least two transcripts per gene are major forms.\\n      The expression pattern of these genes is ubiquitous, with some tissue-specific\\n      differences between several transcript variants.

The project\\n      initially used a random strategy to select clones from a large number of cDNA\\n      libraries from diverse tissues. Candidate clones were chosen based on 5'-EST\\n      sequences, and then fully sequenced to high accuracy and analyzed by algorithms\\n      developed for this project. Currently, more than 11,000 human and 10,000 mouse\\n      genes are represented in MGC by at least one clone with a full ORF. The random\\n      selection approach is now reaching a saturation point, and a transition to\\n      protocols targeted at the missing transcripts is now required to complete the\\n      mouse and human collections. Comparison of the sequence of the MGC clones to\\n      reference genome sequences reveals that most cDNA clones are of very high\\n      sequence quality, although it is likely that some cDNAs may carry missense\\n      variants as a consequence of experimental artifact, such as PCR, cloning, or\\n      reverse transcriptase errors. Recently, a rat cDNA component was added to the\\n      project, and ongoing frog (Xenopus) and zebrafish (Danio) cDNA projects were\\n      expanded to take advantage of the high-throughput MGC pipeline.\\nFAU -

We determined\\n      the entire sequence of 21,243 selected clones and found that 14,490 cDNAs (10,897\\n      clusters) were unique to the FLJ collection. About half of them (5,416) seemed to\\n      be protein-coding. Of those, 1,999 clusters had not been predicted by\\n      computational methods. The distribution of GC content of nonpredicted cDNAs had a\\n      peak at approximately 58% compared with a peak at approximately 42%for predicted \\n      cDNAs. Thus, there seems to be a slight bias against GC-rich transcripts in\\n      current gene prediction procedures. The rest of the cDNAs unique to the FLJ\\n      collection (5,481) contained no obvious open reading frames (ORFs) and thus are\\n      candidate noncoding RNAs. About one-fourth of them (1,378) showed a clear pattern\\n      of splicing. The distribution of GC content of noncoding cDNAs was narrow and had\\n      a peak at approximately 42%, relatively low compared with that of protein-coding \\n      cDNAs.\\nFAU - Ota, Toshio\\nAU  -

It is conceivable, therefore, that such proteins could\\n      function as an intricate framework of assembly protein complexes. To\\n      comprehensively study protein-protein interactions between large KIAA proteins,\\n      we have constructed a library composed of 1087 KIAA cDNA clones based on prior\\n      functional classifications done in silico. We were guided by two principles that \\n      raise the success rate for detecting interactions per tested combination: we\\n      avoided testing low-probability combinations, and reduced the number of potential\\n      false negatives that arise from the fact that large proteins cannot reliably be\\n      expressed in yeast. The latter was addressed by constructing a cDNA library\\n      comprised of random fragments encoding large proteins. Cytoplasmic domains of\\n      KIAA transmembrane proteins (>1000 amino acids) were used as bait for yeast\\n      two-hybrid screening. Our analyses reveal that several KIAA proteins bearing a\\n      transmembrane region have the capability of binding to other KIAA proteins\\n      containing domains (e.g., PDZ, SH3, rhoGEF, and spectrin) known to be localized\\n      to highly specialized submembranous sites, indicating that they participate in\\n      cellular junction formation, receptor or channel clustering, and intracellular\\n      signaling events. Our representative library should be a very useful resource for\\n      detecting previously unidentified interactions because it complements\\n      conventional expression libraries, which seldom contain large cDNAs.\\nFAU - Nakayama, Manabu\\nAU  - Nakayama M\\nAD  - Department of Human Gene Research, Kazusa DNA Research Institute, Kisarazu, Chiba\\n      292-0818, Japan. nmanabu@kazusa.or.jp\\nFAU - Kikuno, Reiko\\nAU  - Kikuno R\\nFAU - Ohara, Osamu\\nAU  - Ohara O\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't\\nPL  - United States\\nTA  - Genome Res\\nJT  - Genome research\\nJID - 9518021\\nRN  - 0 (DNA, Complementary)\\nRN  - 0 (Peptides)\\nRN  - 0 (Proteins)\\nSB  - IM\\nMH  - Brain Chemistry/genetics\\nMH  - Cloning, Molecular\\nMH  - Computational Biology/instrumentation/methods\\nMH  - Cytoplasm/chemistry\\nMH  - DNA, Complementary/chemistry/*genetics\\nMH  - *Gene Library\\nMH  - Humans\\nMH  - Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/pathology\\nMH  - Peptide Mapping/methods\\nMH  - Peptides/genetics/physiology\\nMH  - Protein Interaction Mapping/*methods\\nMH  - Protein Structure, Tertiary/physiology\\nMH  - Proteins/chemistry/genetics/physiology\\nMH  - Software\\nMH  - Tumor Cells, Cultured\\nMH  - *Two-Hybrid System Techniques\\nMH  - src Homology Domains/genetics/physiology\\nPMC - PMC187542\\nOID - NLM: PMC187542\\nEDAT- 2002/11/08 04:00\\nMHDA- 2003/01/15 04:00\\nCRDT- 2002/11/08 04:00\\nPHST- 2002/11/08 04:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2003/01/15 04:00 [medline]\\nPHST- 2002/11/08 04:00 [entrez]\\nAID - 10.1101/gr.406902 [doi]\\nPST - ppublish\\nSO  - Genome Res. 2002 Nov;12(11):1773-84. doi: 10.1101/gr.406902.\", \"PMID- 9455484\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- MEDLINE\\nDCOM- 19980227\\nLR  - 20061115\\nIS  - 1340-2838 (Print)\\nIS  - 1340-2838 (Linking)\\nVI  - 4\\nIP  - 5\\nDP  - 1997 Oct 31\\nTI  - Characterization of cDNA clones in size-fractionated cDNA libraries from human\\n      brain.\\nPG  - 345-9\\nAB  - To evaluate the size-fractionated cDNA libraries of human brain previously\\n      constructed (O. O'hara et al. DNA Research, 4, 53-59, 1997), the occurrence of\\n      chimeric clones and the content of clones with coding potentiality were analyzed \\n      using the randomly sampled clones with insert sizes of 5 to 7 kb. When the\\n      chromosomal location of 30 clones was determined by the radiation-hybrid mapping \\n      method, the map positions assigned from the 3'- and 5'-end sequences separately\\n      were coincident for 29 clones, suggesting that the occurrence of chimeric clones \\n      is at most 1/30. Using 91 clones mapped to chromosome 1, the content of clones\\n      that have the potentiality coding for proteins larger than 100 amino acid\\n      residues was estimated to be approximately 50% (46 out of 91 clones) on the basis\\n      of nucleotide sequence analysis and coding potentiality assay in vitro.

We here describe a novel \\\"double adaptor\\\" \\n      strategy for efficient construction of high-quality shotgun libraries. In this\\n      method, randomly sheared and end-repaired fragments are ligated to\\n      oligonucleotide adaptors creating 12-base overhangs. Nonphosphorylated\\n      oligonucleotides are used, which prevents formation of adaptor dimers and ensures\\n      efficient ligation of insert to adaptor. The vector is prepared from a modified\\n      M13 vector, by KpnI/PstI digestion followed by ligation to oligonucleotides with \\n      ends complementary to the overhangs created in the digest. These adaptors create \\n      5'-overhangs complementary to those on the inserts. Following annealing of insert\\n      to vector, the DNA is directly used for transformation without a ligation step.\\n      This protocol is robust and shows three- to fivefold higher yield of clones\\n      compared to previous protocols. No chimeric clones can be detected and the\\n      background of clones without an insert is <1%. The procedure is rapid and shows\\n      potential for automation.\\nFAU - Andersson, B\\nAU  - Andersson B\\nAD  - Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, One\\n      Baylor Plaza, Houston, Texas, 77030, USA.\\nFAU - Wentland, M A\\nAU  - Wentland MA\\nFAU - Ricafrente, J Y\\nAU  - Ricafrente JY\\nFAU - Liu, W\\nAU  - Liu W\\nFAU - Gibbs, R A\\nAU  - Gibbs RA\\nLA  - eng\\nSI  - GENBANK/AF007128\\nSI  - GENBANK/AF007129\\nSI  - GENBANK/AF007130\\nSI  - GENBANK/AF007131\\nSI  - GENBANK/AF007132\\nSI  - GENBANK/AF007133\\nSI  - GENBANK/AF007134\\nSI  - GENBANK/AF007135\\nSI  - GENBANK/AF007136\\nSI  - GENBANK/AF007137\\nSI  - GENBANK/AF007138\\nSI  - GENBANK/AF007139\\nSI  - GENBANK/AF007140\\nSI  - GENBANK/AF007141\\nSI  - GENBANK/AF007142\\nSI  - GENBANK/AF007143\\nSI  - GENBANK/AF007144\\nSI  - GENBANK/AF007145\\nSI  - GENBANK/AF007146\\nSI  - GENBANK/AF007147\\nSI  - GENBANK/AF007148\\nSI  - GENBANK/AF007149\\nSI  - GENBANK/AF007150\\nSI  - GENBANK/AF007151\\nSI  - GENBANK/AF007152\\nSI  - GENBANK/AF007153\\nSI  - GENBANK/AF007154\\nGR  - R01 HG00823/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nPT  - Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.\\nPL  - United States\\nTA  - Anal Biochem\\nJT  - Analytical biochemistry\\nJID - 0370535\\nRN  - 0 (Oligonucleotides)\\nSB  - IM\\nMH  - Base Sequence\\nMH  - Cloning, Molecular/*methods\\nMH  - Genetic Vectors\\nMH  - *Genomic Library\\nMH  - Humans\\nMH  - Molecular Sequence Data\\nMH  - Oligonucleotides/chemistry\\nMH  - Polymerase Chain Reaction\\nMH  - X Chromosome\\nEDAT- 1996/04/05 00:00\\nMHDA- 1996/04/05 00:01\\nCRDT- 1996/04/05 00:00\\nPHST- 1996/04/05 00:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 1996/04/05 00:01 [medline]\\nPHST- 1996/04/05 00:00 [entrez]\\nAID - S0003-2697(96)90138-4 [pii]\\nAID - 10.1006/abio.1996.0138 [doi]\\nPST - ppublish\\nSO  - Anal Biochem. 1996 Apr 5;236(1):107-13. doi: 10.1006/abio.1996.0138.\", \"PMID- 26344197\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- MEDLINE\\nDCOM- 20151014\\nLR  - 20170220\\nIS  - 1476-4687 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 0028-0836 (Linking)\\nVI  - 525\\nIP  - 7569\\nDP  - 2015 Sep 17\\nTI  - Panorama of ancient metazoan macromolecular complexes.\\nPG  - 339-44\\nLID - 10.1038/nature14877 [doi]\\nAB  - Macromolecular complexes are essential to conserved biological processes, but\\n      their prevalence across animals is unclear.

To discover \\n      a novel locus, we performed in vitro genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and\\n      further tested the result in a cohort of septic shock patients. METHODS: Two in\\n      vitro GWAS using a quantitative trait locus analysis of stimulated IL-6\\n      production in lymphoblastoid cells from 60 individuals of European ancestry were \\n      performed. VPS13D rs6685273 was genotyped in European ancestry patients (n =\\n      498). The VPS13D gene was silenced in vitro. RESULTS: Two GWAS using\\n      lymphoblastoid cells identified the locus of VPS13D rs6685273 that was\\n      significant in the same direction in both GWAS. The VPS13D rs6685273 C allele was\\n      associated with increased IL-6 production. Patients with septic shock who had the\\n      VPS13D rs6685273 CC genotype had an increased 28-day mortality (p = 0.023) and\\n      more organ failure (p < 0.05) compared to the CT/TT genotypes. VPS13D in vitro\\n      gene silencing in the HeLa cell line increased IL-6 production. Furthermore, the \\n      rs6685273 genotype was associated with differential VPS13D splice variant\\n      expression. CONCLUSIONS: The VPS13D rs6685273 C allele was associated with\\n      increased IL-6 production in vitro. The patients with the VPS13D rs6685273 CC\\n      genotype had increased 28-day mortality and increased organ failure. VPS13D\\n      appears to regulate IL-6 production.\\nCI  - (c) 2015 S.

However,\\n      little is known about the genetic basis of PAD. To elucidate this, we performed a\\n      two-staged genome-wide association study in Japanese individuals. METHODS: We\\n      initially tested 222,285 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). After the first \\n      screening in a panel of 195 PAD cases and 1,358 controls, 2,696 SNPs (1.2%) were \\n      further genotyped in the second screening using another panel of 699 PAD cases\\n      and 1540 controls. In both screenings, controls were subjects affected with some \\n      diseases other than PAD. RESULTS: When analyzed in the combined panel, the\\n      strongest signal of PAD association was observed at rs1902341 in the intron of\\n      OSBPL10 (p=4.7E-7 for trend test; OR=1.31, 95% CI 1.18-1.46). Also, PAD was\\n      modestly associated at several other loci such as rs2554503 in CSMD1 (p=5.7E-5;\\n      OR=1.32, 95% CI 1.15-1.51) or rs235243 in VSP13D (p=0.04; OR=1.18, 95% CI\\n      1.01-1.37). CONCLUSION: Our genome-wide exploration identified suggestive\\n      evidence of PAD association at the OSBPL10 locus. Because the association has not\\n      reached a genome-wide significant level, further replication study is warranted\\n      for verification in the Japanese population.\\nFAU - Koriyama, Hiroshi\\nAU  - Koriyama H\\nAD  - Department of Geriatric Medicine and Nephrology, Osaka University Graduate School\\n      of Medicine, 2-2 Yamada-oka, Suita, Japan.\\nFAU - Nakagami, Hironori\\nAU  - Nakagami H\\nFAU - Katsuya, Tomohiro\\nAU  - Katsuya T\\nFAU - Sugimoto, Ken\\nAU  - Sugimoto K\\nFAU - Yamashita, Hidetoshi\\nAU  - Yamashita H\\nFAU - Takami, Yoichi\\nAU  - Takami Y\\nFAU - Maeda, Shiro\\nAU  - Maeda S\\nFAU - Kubo, Michiaki\\nAU  - Kubo M\\nFAU - Takahashi, Atsushi\\nAU  - Takahashi A\\nFAU - Nakamura, Yusuke\\nAU  - Nakamura Y\\nFAU - Ogihara, Toshio\\nAU  - Ogihara T\\nFAU - Rakugi, Hiromi\\nAU  - Rakugi H\\nFAU - Kaneda, Yasufumi\\nAU  - Kaneda Y\\nFAU - Morishita, Ryuichi\\nAU  - Morishita R\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Comparative Study\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't\\nDEP - 20100702\\nPL  - Japan\\nTA  - J Atheroscler Thromb\\nJT  - Journal of atherosclerosis and thrombosis\\nJID - 9506298\\nRN  - 0 (Receptors, Steroid)\\nRN  - 0 (oxysterol binding protein)\\nSB  - IM\\nMH  - Aged\\nMH  - Asian Continental Ancestry Group/*genetics\\nMH  - Case-Control Studies\\nMH  - Female\\nMH  - Genetic Predisposition to Disease\\nMH  - Genome, Human\\nMH  - *Genome-Wide Association Study\\nMH  - Genotype\\nMH  - Humans\\nMH  - Japan/epidemiology\\nMH  - Linkage Disequilibrium\\nMH  - Male\\nMH  - Middle Aged\\nMH  - Peripheral Vascular Diseases/epidemiology/*genetics\\nMH  - Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics\\nMH  - Receptors, Steroid/*genetics\\nEDAT- 2010/07/09 06:00\\nMHDA- 2011/03/09 06:00\\nCRDT- 2010/07/09 06:00\\nPHST- 2010/07/09 06:00 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2010/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2011/03/09 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - JST.JSTAGE/jat/4291 [pii]\\nPST - ppublish\\nSO  - J Atheroscler Thromb. 2010 Oct 27;17(10):1054-62.

Treatment\\n      studies document the efficacy of precessation NRT and support important roles for\\n      level of nicotine dependence and precessation smoking reduction in successful\\n      quitting. However, prior work has not identified the optimal precessation dose or\\n      means for personalizing NRT. Genome-wide association has identified groups of\\n      genomic markers associated with successful quitting, allowing us to develop a\\n      v1.0 \\\"quit-success\\\" genotype score. We now report influences of v1.0 quit-success\\n      genotype score, level of dependence and precessation smoking reduction in a\\n      smoking cessation trial that examined effects of 21 versus 42 mg/24 h\\n      precessation NRT. Four hundred seventy-nine smokers were randomized to 21 or 42\\n      mg NRT, initiated 2 wks prior to target quit dates. We monitored self-reported\\n      abstinence and end-expired air carbon monoxide (CO). Genotyping used Affymetrix\\n      arrays (Santa Clara, CA, USA). The primary outcome was 10-wk continuous smoking\\n      abstinence. NRT dose, level of nicotine dependence and genotype scores displayed \\n      significant interactive effects on successful quitting. Successful abstinence\\n      also was predicted by CO reductions during precessation NRT. These results\\n      document ways in which smoking cessation strategies can be personalized based on \\n      levels of nicotine dependence, genotype scores and CO monitoring. These\\n      assessments, taken together, can help match most smokers with optimal NRT doses\\n      and help rapidly identify some who may be better treated using other methods.\\nFAU - Rose, Jed E\\nAU  - Rose JE\\nAD  - Department of Psychiatry and Center for Nicotine and Smoking Cessation Research, \\n      Duke University, Durham, North Carolina 27705, USA. rose0003@mc.duke.edu\\nFAU - Behm, Frederique M\\nAU  - Behm FM\\nFAU - Drgon, Tomas\\nAU  - Drgon T\\nFAU - Johnson, Catherine\\nAU  - Johnson C\\nFAU - Uhl, George R\\nAU  - Uhl GR\\nLA  - eng\\nSI  - ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT00734617\\nGR  - P50 DA027840/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States\\nGR  - Intramural NIH HHS/United States\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nPT  - Randomized Controlled Trial\\nPT  - Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural\\nPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't\\nDEP - 20100317\\nPL  - United States\\nTA  - Mol Med\\nJT  - Molecular medicine (Cambridge, Mass.)\\nJID - 9501023\\nRN  - 0 (Delayed-Action Preparations)\\nRN  - 6M3C89ZY6R (Nicotine)\\nRN  - 7U1EE4V452 (Carbon Monoxide)\\nSB  - IM\\nEIN - Mol Med. 2012;18(1):729\\nMH  - Administration, Cutaneous\\nMH  - Adult\\nMH  - Carbon Monoxide/analysis\\nMH  - Delayed-Action Preparations\\nMH  - Double-Blind Method\\nMH  - Female\\nMH  - Genome-Wide Association Study\\nMH  - Genotype\\nMH  - Humans\\nMH  - Logistic Models\\nMH  - Male\\nMH  - Middle Aged\\nMH  - Nicotine/*administration & dosage\\nMH  - Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide\\nMH  - Precision Medicine/*methods\\nMH  - Smoking Cessation/*methods\\nMH  - Tobacco Use Disorder/*drug therapy/*genetics\\nPMC - PMC2896464\\nOID - NLM: PMC2896464\\nEDAT- 2010/04/10 06:00\\nMHDA- 2010/11/09 06:00\\nCRDT- 2010/04/10 06:00\\nPHST- 2009/10/31 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2010/03/16 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2010/04/10 06:00 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2010/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2010/11/09 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - molmed.2009.00159 [pii]\\nAID - 10.2119/molmed.2009.00159 [doi]\\nPST - ppublish\\nSO  - Mol Med. 2010 Jul-Aug;16(7-8):247-53. doi: 10.2119/molmed.2009.00159.

We detected several similar\\n      putative human proteins by BLAST analysis of chorein. We characterized the\\n      structure of three new genes encoding these CHAC-similar proteins, located on\\n      chromosomes 1p36, 8q22, and 15q21. The most similar gene in yeast to all four\\n      human genes is Vps13, and therefore the human genes were named VPS13A (CHAC,\\n      9q21), VPS13B (8q22), VPS13C (15q21), and VPS13D (1p36). VPS13B has recently been\\n      reported as COH1, altered in Cohen syndrome. For each gene, we describe several\\n      alternative splicing variants; at least two transcripts per gene are major forms.\\n      The expression pattern of these genes is ubiquitous, with some tissue-specific\\n      differences between several transcript variants.

The project\\n      initially used a random strategy to select clones from a large number of cDNA\\n      libraries from diverse tissues. Candidate clones were chosen based on 5'-EST\\n      sequences, and then fully sequenced to high accuracy and analyzed by algorithms\\n      developed for this project. Currently, more than 11,000 human and 10,000 mouse\\n      genes are represented in MGC by at least one clone with a full ORF. The random\\n      selection approach is now reaching a saturation point, and a transition to\\n      protocols targeted at the missing transcripts is now required to complete the\\n      mouse and human collections. Comparison of the sequence of the MGC clones to\\n      reference genome sequences reveals that most cDNA clones are of very high\\n      sequence quality, although it is likely that some cDNAs may carry missense\\n      variants as a consequence of experimental artifact, such as PCR, cloning, or\\n      reverse transcriptase errors. Recently, a rat cDNA component was added to the\\n      project, and ongoing frog (Xenopus) and zebrafish (Danio) cDNA projects were\\n      expanded to take advantage of the high-throughput MGC pipeline.\\nFAU -

We determined\\n      the entire sequence of 21,243 selected clones and found that 14,490 cDNAs (10,897\\n      clusters) were unique to the FLJ collection. About half of them (5,416) seemed to\\n      be protein-coding. Of those, 1,999 clusters had not been predicted by\\n      computational methods. The distribution of GC content of nonpredicted cDNAs had a\\n      peak at approximately 58% compared with a peak at approximately 42%for predicted \\n      cDNAs. Thus, there seems to be a slight bias against GC-rich transcripts in\\n      current gene prediction procedures. The rest of the cDNAs unique to the FLJ\\n      collection (5,481) contained no obvious open reading frames (ORFs) and thus are\\n      candidate noncoding RNAs. About one-fourth of them (1,378) showed a clear pattern\\n      of splicing. The distribution of GC content of noncoding cDNAs was narrow and had\\n      a peak at approximately 42%, relatively low compared with that of protein-coding \\n      cDNAs.\\nFAU - Ota, Toshio\\nAU  -

It is conceivable, therefore, that such proteins could\\n      function as an intricate framework of assembly protein complexes. To\\n      comprehensively study protein-protein interactions between large KIAA proteins,\\n      we have constructed a library composed of 1087 KIAA cDNA clones based on prior\\n      functional classifications done in silico. We were guided by two principles that \\n      raise the success rate for detecting interactions per tested combination: we\\n      avoided testing low-probability combinations, and reduced the number of potential\\n      false negatives that arise from the fact that large proteins cannot reliably be\\n      expressed in yeast. The latter was addressed by constructing a cDNA library\\n      comprised of random fragments encoding large proteins. Cytoplasmic domains of\\n      KIAA transmembrane proteins (>1000 amino acids) were used as bait for yeast\\n      two-hybrid screening. Our analyses reveal that several KIAA proteins bearing a\\n      transmembrane region have the capability of binding to other KIAA proteins\\n      containing domains (e.g., PDZ, SH3, rhoGEF, and spectrin) known to be localized\\n      to highly specialized submembranous sites, indicating that they participate in\\n      cellular junction formation, receptor or channel clustering, and intracellular\\n      signaling events. Our representative library should be a very useful resource for\\n      detecting previously unidentified interactions because it complements\\n      conventional expression libraries, which seldom contain large cDNAs.\\nFAU - Nakayama, Manabu\\nAU  - Nakayama M\\nAD  - Department of Human Gene Research, Kazusa DNA Research Institute, Kisarazu, Chiba\\n      292-0818, Japan. nmanabu@kazusa.or.jp\\nFAU - Kikuno, Reiko\\nAU  - Kikuno R\\nFAU - Ohara, Osamu\\nAU  - Ohara O\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't\\nPL  - United States\\nTA  - Genome Res\\nJT  - Genome research\\nJID - 9518021\\nRN  - 0 (DNA, Complementary)\\nRN  - 0 (Peptides)\\nRN  - 0 (Proteins)\\nSB  - IM\\nMH  - Brain Chemistry/genetics\\nMH  - Cloning, Molecular\\nMH  - Computational Biology/instrumentation/methods\\nMH  - Cytoplasm/chemistry\\nMH  - DNA, Complementary/chemistry/*genetics\\nMH  - *Gene Library\\nMH  - Humans\\nMH  - Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/pathology\\nMH  - Peptide Mapping/methods\\nMH  - Peptides/genetics/physiology\\nMH  - Protein Interaction Mapping/*methods\\nMH  - Protein Structure, Tertiary/physiology\\nMH  - Proteins/chemistry/genetics/physiology\\nMH  - Software\\nMH  - Tumor Cells, Cultured\\nMH  - *Two-Hybrid System Techniques\\nMH  - src Homology Domains/genetics/physiology\\nPMC - PMC187542\\nOID - NLM: PMC187542\\nEDAT- 2002/11/08 04:00\\nMHDA- 2003/01/15 04:00\\nCRDT- 2002/11/08 04:00\\nPHST- 2002/11/08 04:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2003/01/15 04:00 [medline]\\nPHST- 2002/11/08 04:00 [entrez]\\nAID - 10.1101/gr.406902 [doi]\\nPST - ppublish\\nSO  - Genome Res. 2002 Nov;12(11):1773-84. doi: 10.1101/gr.406902.\", \"PMID- 9455484\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- MEDLINE\\nDCOM- 19980227\\nLR  - 20061115\\nIS  - 1340-2838 (Print)\\nIS  - 1340-2838 (Linking)\\nVI  - 4\\nIP  - 5\\nDP  - 1997 Oct 31\\nTI  - Characterization of cDNA clones in size-fractionated cDNA libraries from human\\n      brain.\\nPG  - 345-9\\nAB  - To evaluate the size-fractionated cDNA libraries of human brain previously\\n      constructed (O. O'hara et al. DNA Research, 4, 53-59, 1997), the occurrence of\\n      chimeric clones and the content of clones with coding potentiality were analyzed \\n      using the randomly sampled clones with insert sizes of 5 to 7 kb. When the\\n      chromosomal location of 30 clones was determined by the radiation-hybrid mapping \\n      method, the map positions assigned from the 3'- and 5'-end sequences separately\\n      were coincident for 29 clones, suggesting that the occurrence of chimeric clones \\n      is at most 1/30. Using 91 clones mapped to chromosome 1, the content of clones\\n      that have the potentiality coding for proteins larger than 100 amino acid\\n      residues was estimated to be approximately 50% (46 out of 91 clones) on the basis\\n      of nucleotide sequence analysis and coding potentiality assay in vitro. No\\n      significant open reading frames were detected in the remaining clones. Although\\n      the clones coding for short peptides may not have been included in the above\\n      estimation, the libraries constructed from the whole brain mRNA fraction appear\\n      to contain a considerable amount of clones corresponding to the 5'-truncated\\n      transcripts in an unprocessed form and/or those with long 3'-untranslated\\n      regions.\\nFAU - Seki, N\\nAU  - Seki N\\nAD  - Kazusa DNA Research Institute, Chiba, Japan. nseki@kazusa.or.jp\\nFAU - Ohira, M\\nAU  - Ohira M\\nFAU - Nagase, T\\nAU  - Nagase T\\nFAU - Ishikawa, K\\nAU  - Ishikawa K\\nFAU - Miyajima, N\\nAU  - Miyajima N\\nFAU - Nakajima, D\\nAU  - Nakajima D\\nFAU - Nomura, N\\nAU  - Nomura N\\nFAU - Ohara, O\\nAU  - Ohara O\\nLA  - eng\\nSI  - GENBANK/AB007913\\nSI  - GENBANK/AB007914\\nSI  - GENBANK/AB007915\\nSI  - GENBANK/AB007916\\nSI  - GENBANK/AB007917\\nSI  - GENBANK/AB007918\\nSI  - GENBANK/AB007919\\nSI  - GENBANK/AB007920\\nSI  - GENBANK/AB007921\\nSI  - GENBANK/AB007922\\nSI  - GENBANK/AB007923\\nSI  - GENBANK/AB007924\\nSI  - GENBANK/AB007925\\nSI  - GENBANK/AB007926\\nSI  - GENBANK/AB007927\\nSI  - GENBANK/AB007928\\nSI  - GENBANK/AB007929\\nSI  - GENBANK/AB007930\\nSI  - GENBANK/AB007931\\nSI  - GENBANK/AB007932\\nSI  - GENBANK/AB007933\\nSI  - GENBANK/AB007934\\nSI  - GENBANK/AB007935\\nSI  - GENBANK/AB007936\\nSI  - GENBANK/AB007937\\nSI  - GENBANK/AB007938\\nSI  - GENBANK/AB007939\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't\\nPL  - England\\nTA  - DNA Res\\nJT  - DNA research : an international journal for rapid publication of reports on genes\\n      and genomes\\nJID - 9423827\\nRN  - 0 (DNA, Complementary)\\nRN  - 0 (DNAJC6 protein, human)\\nRN  - 0 (HSP40 Heat-Shock Proteins)\\nRN  - 0 (RNA, Messenger)\\nSB  - IM\\nMH  - Animals\\nMH  - Brain Chemistry/*genetics\\nMH  - Chimera\\nMH  - *Chromosome Mapping\\nMH  - *Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1\\nMH  - Cloning, Molecular\\nMH  - DNA, Complementary/*chemistry/genetics/*isolation & purification\\nMH  - Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel\\nMH  - Gene Library\\nMH  - HSP40 Heat-Shock Proteins\\nMH  - Humans\\nMH  - Open Reading Frames\\nMH  - Polymerase Chain Reaction\\nMH  - RNA, Messenger/genetics\\nMH  - Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid\\nMH  - Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid\\nMH  - Sequence Tagged Sites\\nMH  - Transcription, Genetic\\nEDAT- 1998/02/10 00:00\\nMHDA- 1998/02/10 00:01\\nCRDT- 1998/02/10 00:00\\nPHST- 1998/02/10 00:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 1998/02/10 00:01 [medline]\\nPHST- 1998/02/10 00:00 [entrez]\\nPST - ppublish\\nSO  - DNA Res. 1997 Oct 31;4(5):345-9.\", \"PMID- 9110174\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- MEDLINE\\nDCOM- 19970617\\nLR  - 20161019\\nIS  - 1088-9051 (Print)\\nIS  - 1088-9051 (Linking)\\nVI  - 7\\nIP  - 4\\nDP  - 1997 Apr\\nTI  - Large-scale concatenation cDNA sequencing.\\nPG  - 353-8\\nAB  - A total of 100 kb of DNA derived from 69 individual human brain cDNA clones of\\n      0.7-2.0 kb were sequenced by concatenated cDNA sequencing (CCS), whereby multiple\\n      individual DNA fragments are sequenced simultaneously in a single shotgun\\n      library. The method yielded accurate sequences and a similar efficiency compared \\n      with other shotgun libraries constructed from single DNA fragments (> 20 kb).\\n      Computer analyses were carried out on 65 cDNA clone sequences and their\\n      corresponding end sequences to examine both nucleic acid and amino acid sequence \\n      similarities in the databases. Thirty-seven clones revealed no DNA database\\n      matches, 12 clones generated exact matches (> or = 98% identity), and 16 clones\\n      generated nonexact matches (57%-97% identity) to either known human or other\\n      species genes. Of those 28 matched clones, 8 had corresponding end sequences that\\n      failed to identify similarities. In a protein similarity search, 27 clone\\n      sequences displayed significant matches, whereas only 20 of the end sequences had\\n      matches to known protein sequences.

We here describe a novel \\\"double adaptor\\\" \\n      strategy for efficient construction of high-quality shotgun libraries. In this\\n      method, randomly sheared and end-repaired fragments are ligated to\\n      oligonucleotide adaptors creating 12-base overhangs. Nonphosphorylated\\n      oligonucleotides are used, which prevents formation of adaptor dimers and ensures\\n      efficient ligation of insert to adaptor. The vector is prepared from a modified\\n      M13 vector, by KpnI/PstI digestion followed by ligation to oligonucleotides with \\n      ends complementary to the overhangs created in the digest. These adaptors create \\n      5'-overhangs complementary to those on the inserts. Following annealing of insert\\n      to vector, the DNA is directly used for transformation without a ligation step.\\n      This protocol is robust and shows three- to fivefold higher yield of clones\\n      compared to previous protocols. No chimeric clones can be detected and the\\n      background of clones without an insert is <1%. The procedure is rapid and shows\\n      potential for automation.\\nFAU - Andersson, B\\nAU  - Andersson B\\nAD  - Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, One\\n      Baylor Plaza, Houston, Texas, 77030, USA.\\nFAU - Wentland, M A\\nAU  - Wentland MA\\nFAU - Ricafrente, J Y\\nAU  - Ricafrente JY\\nFAU - Liu, W\\nAU  - Liu W\\nFAU - Gibbs, R A\\nAU  - Gibbs RA\\nLA  - eng\\nSI  - GENBANK/AF007128\\nSI  - GENBANK/AF007129\\nSI  - GENBANK/AF007130\\nSI  - GENBANK/AF007131\\nSI  - GENBANK/AF007132\\nSI  - GENBANK/AF007133\\nSI  - GENBANK/AF007134\\nSI  - GENBANK/AF007135\\nSI  - GENBANK/AF007136\\nSI  - GENBANK/AF007137\\nSI  - GENBANK/AF007138\\nSI  - GENBANK/AF007139\\nSI  - GENBANK/AF007140\\nSI  - GENBANK/AF007141\\nSI  - GENBANK/AF007142\\nSI  - GENBANK/AF007143\\nSI  - GENBANK/AF007144\\nSI  - GENBANK/AF007145\\nSI  - GENBANK/AF007146\\nSI  - GENBANK/AF007147\\nSI  - GENBANK/AF007148\\nSI  - GENBANK/AF007149\\nSI  - GENBANK/AF007150\\nSI  - GENBANK/AF007151\\nSI  - GENBANK/AF007152\\nSI  - GENBANK/AF007153\\nSI  - GENBANK/AF007154\\nGR  - R01 HG00823/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nPT  - Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.\\nPL  - United States\\nTA  - Anal Biochem\\nJT  - Analytical biochemistry\\nJID - 0370535\\nRN  - 0 (Oligonucleotides)\\nSB  - IM\\nMH  - Base Sequence\\nMH  - Cloning, Molecular/*methods\\nMH  - Genetic Vectors\\nMH  - *Genomic Library\\nMH  - Humans\\nMH  - Molecular Sequence Data\\nMH  - Oligonucleotides/chemistry\\nMH  - Polymerase Chain Reaction\\nMH  - X Chromosome\\nEDAT- 1996/04/05 00:00\\nMHDA- 1996/04/05 00:01\\nCRDT- 1996/04/05 00:00\\nPHST- 1996/04/05 00:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 1996/04/05 00:01 [medline]\\nPHST- 1996/04/05 00:00 [entrez]\\nAID - S0003-2697(96)90138-4 [pii]\\nAID - 10.1006/abio.1996.0138 [doi]\\nPST - ppublish\\nSO  - Anal Biochem. 1996 Apr 5;236(1):107-13. doi: 10.1006/abio.1996.0138.\"]"
